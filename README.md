# Patrick's BM CSS

##Road plan:

1. Compile research about what it means to create the CSS we need
2. Compile research on the different methodologies/frameworks/mindset in the CSS world
3. Figure out how to break down the parts of the webpage into small lego/atomic/etc building blocks
4. Figure out how this ties into HTML/JS
5. Write out a concise overview of the CSS I will write
6. Write the CSS
7. Find an auto-documentation solution
8. Build presentation


##Goals
1. High performing
2. Clear and semantic
3. Build for reuse
4. Responsive across the board
5. CSS should have a linear-ish progress of specificity as you travel down the cascade (elements - base classes (margin, padding, etc) - sub components - components


##Ideals & Tenants
1. Classes should be free of side-effects
2. Properties should be assigned to classes as few times as possible reducing how often we use a property like line-height or margin
3. Classes should be broken down into use-based categories
4. Styles should layer on top of each other and never mutate each other
5. Elements should have minimum innate styles
6. Styles should always work from the smallest, hierarchically, elements first all the way to the top (Atomic)
7. Documentation should generated automatically
8. Styles should be easy to remember & documentation should be easy to traverse

##Key Questions
1. How will this solution scale as the products grow
2. What is the long term investment with this solution?
3. Do we need to write our own documentation?
4. How do we tackle on-boarding?
5. What is the short term investment to implement this solution?
6. Are there infrastructure changes that will need to be made?
7. How much time will this investment be?
8. What naming scheme are you suggesting and how does that impact the rest of the codebase?
